# Introduction

_Haskell for Working Programmers_ is a guide for professional programmers for picking up Haskell.

One of the best-kept secrets in programming languages is that Haskell is actually not that hard. The problem is that the learning materials swing too hard in either direction, assuming that you are either a complete beginner or a CS theory academic.

This guide is intended for readers with a working, professional knowledge of an existing popular programming language like JavaScript, Go, or Python. We'll start by getting you writing and building a project on your own computer, and teach Haskell-specific concepts by comparing, contrasting, and drawing analogies to more common languages. We'll also hold your hand through yak shaving and walk you through various tips, tricks, and hard-earned secrets learned by using Haskell in anger.

Haskell is a great language with lots of interesting ideas that are broadly applicable across other programming languages. Even if you don't use Haskell in production at work, you will hopefully take some of these ideas away to improve the correctness, maintainability, and reliability of your work in other languages.
