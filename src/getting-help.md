# Getting help

Before we jump in, a quick aside.

Learning Haskell is hard. It's way, way harder to do by yourself. The good news is that you don't have to! The best place to ask for help that I've found is the Functional Programming Slack, at [`fpslack.com`](https://fpslack.com). They are extremely beginner-friendly. Don't be shy about your questions!

If you find other great resources, feel free to open a pull request on this book, and we'll get it added.
